Hello friends and colleagues, 

I am a recent graduate at the University of California, Riverside who obtained a BA in Business Economics with a concentration
in computational statisics. I am also Revenue Data Analyst @Seel. I have a strong interested in building Full-Stack Web 
Applications with MERN stack and advancing my data science skills in SQL and Python. I am currently obtaining my 
Data Engineering Certificate at Datacamp. I recently finished my full-stack web development bootcamp so I have multiple 
projects on CSS/HTML and multiple DOM vanilla js projects. I am always open to learning so be sure to let me know if you have 
any courses or books to read for anything that has to do with Data Science. If you have any questions or concerns regarding 
anything, feel free to contact me at Jeffrey@seel.com


Cheers,
Jeffrey
