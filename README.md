Hello friends and colleagues, 

I am a graduate at the University of California, Riverside who obtained a degree in Business Economics with a concentration
in computational statisics and a Revenue Data Analyst @Seel.

My technical skill sets include: Terminal/Linus commands, CSS(Bootstrap), HTML, Javascript(Node.js/ Dom Manipulation), Python(libraries: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas), and SQL. 

I have a strong interested in building Full-Stack Web Applications with MERN stack and advancing my data science skills in SQL and Python. I am currently obtaining my Data Engineering Certificate at Datacamp. 

I recently finished my full-stack web development bootcamp so I have multiple projects on CSS/HTML and multiple DOM vanilla js projects, including my own website that I am currently building. I am always open to learning so be sure to let me know if you have any courses reccomendations or books to read for anything that has to do with Data Science. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding anything, feel free to contact me at Jeffrey@seel.com


Cheers,
Jeffrey Chi
